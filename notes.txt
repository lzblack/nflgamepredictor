1. pf_winlosses() weeks only actually need to be set from 2 to 18 instead of 2 to 19 because we are concerned with the PF/PA nad W/L going into the game, not after the game.
2. Found that once you get to year 2016 the abbreviation for Jacksonville changes from JAC to JAX, so must use this code games = nflgame.games(2016, week=2, home='JAX', away='JAX', kind='REG', started=False)
3. games = nflgame.games(2017, week=1, home='TB', away='TB', kind='REG', started=False) is an empty list not an object. Tampa Bay and Miami had Bye Weeks week 1 of the season, wtf
4. went into gamelines.csv and corrected by hand b/c i was having toruble doing it in python
5. Replaced all LAR's in gamelines.csv with LA's b/c this matches initial merge
